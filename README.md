# MedicalClinic
The project simulatess filling out a form at a medical clinic, which has the frontEnd part that uses frameworks such as angular and bootstrap. For the backEnd, the java language is used with spring and spring boot technologies, when the backEnd and frontEnd are finished, they will be connected so that there is some interaction.


First we have the 'master' branch which is the main branch, it has all the developments already finished!

We have the branches which are the 'milestone-CRUD' milestones together with the technical branch 'CRUD' which is responsible for the connection between the backend and the frontend;

'milestone-frontEnd' together with technical branch 'frontEnd-earlyDevelopment' is the milestone fully responsible for fronEnd;


'milestone-backEnd' together with the technical branch 'frontEnd-earlyDevelopment' is the milestone fully responsible for the backEnd.
